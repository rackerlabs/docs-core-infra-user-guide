Interaction Methods
===================

One of the benefits of having an open standards based cloud, designed for consistency and ease of use, is that there are multiple ways to interact with and manage your cloud resources.

Depending on your needs, you may prefer a web based control panel, software integration with your current applications and workflows, or shell scripting. In almost all cases, the functionality available is going to be similar, so it comes down to a personal choice or business needs. 

The Rackspace Cloud provides OpenStack based Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for all of its management functionality. These APIs are actually what power the Cloud Control Panel, the Command Line Interfaces, and Software Development Kits (as well as providing powerful raw API access). Each of these interfaces take the OpenStack APIs and provide the best user or developer experience for each situation. 

Control Panel
-------------
The Rackspace Cloud Control Panel at https://mycloud.rackspace.com is the easiest way to get started with provisioning cloud resources. 

The Cloud Control Panel provides a simple, unified web based interface that works in all major browsers. After signing up for a Cloud account at rackspace.com, the Cloud Control panel is the first place you will generally visit to get an overview of products and services available, create your first servers and resources, or view more information about your Rackspace account.

The Cloud Control Panel is also where you will often complete some of these other important first tasks:

* obtain your API keys for use with SDKs, Command Line Interfaces (CLI) and direct API usage

* create additional account users and give them permissions if needed

* view and change resource limits (XXX link to this section) 

The Cloud Control Panel may be the only interface needed by many users, especially if you don't need to heavily automate the management of your cloud resources.  

Command Line Interfaces and tools
---------------------------------

As the Rackspace Cloud is based on OpenStack, there are a rich set of open source command line interfaces (CLIs) available for users that want to manage their cloud via shell scripts, manual commands, and more. 

OpenStack novaclient
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The OpenStack tool primarily used for managing Cloud Servers is written in Python and called "nova" (or more formally "novaclient" or "python-novaclient"). 

(There are additional clients for working with Cloud Images (glanceclient), Cloud Files (swiftclient), and more. Which ones you need will depend on what Rackspace services you are using. All are installed and managed in a similar fashion.)

Rackspace provides some additional functionality on top of the base OpenStack environment through OpenStack extensions. In order to have the best experience when using the *novaclient* with Rackspace, you should install the "rackspace-novaclient" package. It will conveniently install not only the required novaclient componenents, but also any necessary or useful extensions/plugins that are applicable to the Rackspace Cloud.

The rackspace-novaclient package can be found at:
* https://github.com/rackerlabs/rackspace-novaclient

However, it is recommended that you use the PyPi (Python Package Index) to install the client, as it will handle installing dependencies and required packages for you. 

A more detailed set of instructions, including how to install the client on most popular operating systems, is located at:

* http://docs.rackspace.com/servers/api/v2/cs-gettingstarted/content/section_gs_install_nova.html

Once you have the client installed, you will need to set up your environment so you can properly authenticate to Rackspace and use the tools. 

If you work with multiple Rackspace regions (XXX link to regions), you may find another tool called *supernova* to be useful. *supernova* provides a way for you to provide credentials and connection information for multiple Rackspace regions, so you can quickly interact with them without changing environment variables or configurations as you may need to do with *novaclient*. 

While *supernova* is not officially supported by Rackspace, it is heavily used and generally found to be extremely stable and useful. You can install *supernova* via PyPi, or locate it at:

* http://supernova.readthedocs.org/en/latest/


Software Development Kits (SDKs), DevOps Tools, and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Users writing applications that are tightly integrated with the Rackspace Cloud may find that the Control Panel and CLIs are not ideal for their purposes. Those developing or distributing applications for their customers, or doing heavy automation of their infrastructure on the Rackspace Cloud, will often find it best to use either direct API access or one of the many available Software Development Kits.  

Software Development Kits (SDKs)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Software development kits take the powerful OpenStack APIs and provide easy to use, language specific interfaces for accessing and integrating them into your applications and workflows.  Often these libraries also abstract the functionality required to support your applications and workloads across multiple cloud endpoints or providers. 

Rackspace supports SDKs for the following languages:

Java
.Net
Node.js
PHP
Python
Ruby

(XXX would be nice to have logos laid out with these ;) )

All of the available (and future) SDKs can be found at:

* https://developer.rackspace.com/sdks/  

You'll find installation instructions, guidance, tutorials and more for each SDK at the developer.rackspace.com site. 

Direct API Access
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each of our cloud services exposes an API which can be leveraged for low-level integration with the service. The OpenStack API is a "REST" ("Representational State Transfer") API, meaning it is logically structured, stateless, and scalable (among other properties). (For more information on REST APIs, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer .)

For most use cases we recommend leveraging one of our supported SDKs versus integrating directly with the APIs. However, knowing the API structure, and being able to make direct, manual calls to the API is a powerful tool for understanding and managing the Rackspace Cloud infrastructure. 

The API Developer Guides for each service are available at http://docs.rackspace.com/.

While there are many ways to directly use the APIs, some of the most common are:

* command line tools like cURL

* browser extensions like Postman for Chrome (I like to higlight this but i'm not sure if it will stay in...?)

* utilities for your specific operating system are often available; check your app store or directory for "REST clients" and you're sure to find one to your liking. 

The API Developer Guides (XXX or whatever gets replaced) provide examples and tutorials on accessing the APIs with cURL and other tools, as well as sample calls and responses. 


DevOps Tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^

For those using popular DevOps tools like Knife, Vagrant, Ansible, Salt, etc. there are typically plugins (official or unofficial) for these automation frameworks.  Examples are:

Knife: https://github.com/opscode/knife-rackspace
Vagrant: https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant-rackspace
Ansible: http://docs.ansible.com/guide_rax.html
Salt: http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/cloud/rackspace.html
