If you work with multiple Rackspace regions, you may find *supernova* 
to be particularly useful. 
*supernova* simplifies the process of 
providing credentials and connection information for multiple Rackspace
regions, so you can quickly interact with multiple regions 
without changing
environment variables or configurations as you may need to do with
*novaclient*.

While *supernova* is not officially supported by Rackspace, it is
heavily used and generally found to be stable and useful. You can
install *supernova* via PyPi, or download it as described in 
`supernova's documentation <http://supernova.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`__.
