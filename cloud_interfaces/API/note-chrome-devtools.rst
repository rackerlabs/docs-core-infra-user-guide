.. note::  
   Because the 
   Cloud Control Panel 
   uses APIs, 
   watching the Cloud Control Panel work 
   can help you learn how to work with APIs. 
           
   To see how the Cloud Control Panel 
   gets its information:
            
   * Launch the 
     `Chrome browser <https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/>`__. 
   * In Chrome, login to your 
     `Cloud Control Panel <https://mycloud.rackspace.com>`__
     account. 
   * From Chrome's menu, select View > Developer > Developer Tools.
   * Experiment in the Cloud Control Panel and observe 
     behind the scenes in Chrome's developer view.
