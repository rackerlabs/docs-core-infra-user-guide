cURL CLI
^^^^^^^^
`cURL <http://curl.haxx.se/>`__
is a general-purpose command-line tool
for interacting with REST APIs.
Using cURL to submit a single request at the command line is
a common method of experimenting with an API before deciding
whether to write software to automate that request. The
:rax-docs:`Rackspace API documentation <>`
includes
many cURL-based examples.

The following Rackspace publications provide basic information
about cURL:

* :rax-docs:`How cURL commands work <servers/api/v2/cn-gettingstarted/content/curl.html>`
* :how-to:`Cloud Files cURL Cookbook <cloud-files-curl-cookbook>`
* :rax-docs:`Authenticate with cURL <servers/api/v2/cs-gettingstarted/content/curl_auth.html>`

In the
:rax-dev:`Developer Center <docs/>`,
you can see examples of using cURL to
send requests to the API endpoints
for many Rackspace cloud services.
Select a service, and then click **SHELL** as your preferred
language to see samples formatted for use at the
command line with cURL.

You can use any tool that enables you to type a command, send it
as a request to a REST API's endpoint,
and then examine the API's response.
