Software Development Kits
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Software development kits (SDKs) provide easy to use, language-specific
interfaces for accessing and integrating APIs into your applications and
workflows. Often these libraries also abstract the functionality required to
support your applications and workloads across multiple cloud endpoints or
providers.

.. note::

    The Rackspace SDKs are no longer actively supported or developed.

Rackspace created SDKs for the following languages:

* Go

* Java

* .Net

* Node.js

* PHP

* Python

* Ruby

You can find links to all the Rackspace-supported SDKs, with installation
instructions, guidance, tutorials, and more in the
:rax-dev:`Rackspace Developer Center`.
