Learning more about SDKs and APIs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Rackspace continuously improves the SDKs and APIs that we support.
Release notes announce new features, bug fixes, and other changes.

For release notes that announce changes to the SDKs, go to :rax-dev:`here <sdks>`.
You can subscribe to an Atom feed for each SDK's release notes
so that you are notified when we update them.

You can also subscribe to a combined Atom feed for all API documents,
including API release notes,

You can learn how to use new features
and influence planned changes by talking with Rackers and
customers:

* Compare notes on best practices with
  other users of SDKs and APIs
  in the
  `Rackspace Community <https://community.rackspace.com/>`__.

* Use IRC on
  `freenode <https://freenode.net/>`__
  at #rackspace

* Raise an issue with `Rackspace support <https://support.rackspace.com/>`__.
