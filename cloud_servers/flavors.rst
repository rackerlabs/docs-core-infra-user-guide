Creating Servers: Flavors and Flavor Classes
=============================================


In Rackspace Cloud Servers, built on OpenStack, there are two concepts  that
help organize different virtual or physical machine characteristics to help  you
make logical decisions about the type of servers you need to create: Flavors and
Flavor Classes.


Flavors
=======

    
A "flavor" is the definition of the characteristics and resources that your
newly created server will have assigned to it. Each flavor is described by an ID
and Description, along with the resource type and allocated amount of each 
resource. 


An example of a Flavor is the **Performance-1-1**, or "1GB Performance" server
flavor. We can see that the **Performance1-1** server will have the following 
characteristics:


ID
^^

This is the unique identifier for the flavor, and what is used when using the 
OpenStack API to specify a desired flavor. Ex. "performance1-1". 

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^

The "friendly" name for the Flavor. Ex. "1GB Performance Server" 

Memory_MB
^^^^^^^^^
The amount of RAM, specified in megabytes; in this example, 1GB of available RAM.

Disk
^^^^
(*Also referred to as "System Disk" in some flavors*)

Sometimes also called "boot disk", this is simply the size of the first disk 
the server will attempt to access and boot from, much like the first physical 
hard drive plugged into a normal computer. A Performance1-1 (and indeed all 
Performance servers) have a 20GB System disk. *Note: if using Cloud Block 
Storage as your boot volume, that
* **volume will take precedence in the boot order over the system disk. See XXX
* **for more info*


Ephemeral
^^^^^^^^^
(*Also known as "**Data disk(s)** in some flavors*")

Data disk space, versus the "System disk" described above, is additional disk 
space, spread across one or more virtual disks, available to use for your 
application data, caching, or other scenarios.
 
Not all Flavors will have Data disks assigned to them; in this example, 
**Performance1-1** does not. 

In addition, there are some important things to be aware of when using your 
Data disks:     

* They will **not be captured** when a snapshot/image of your server is created;
 only the System disk is captured. Using a backup solution like Rackspace Cloud 
 Backup or other technology is **highly recommended** if using the Data disks to 
 store critical data.     

* Data disks may need to be formatted, partitioned, or grouped into a software 
RAID group, depending on your needs. The Data disks are provided as empty or raw
 disks in some cases to allow you maximum flexibility in how you use them.

Swap
^^^^

Swap is the size of an additional partition provided to your instance that would
generally be used by Linux for swap memory space. As of early 2014, a swap 
partition is no longer provided for most flavors, as it can degrade performance 
or hide memory usage issues. Rackspace recommends  choosing a server flavor that
 will have enough RAM to support your application without the use of swap.


VCPUS
^^^^^
The number of virtual CPU cores that will be available. This is important when 
planning and deploying applications that are multi-threaded or CPU constrained. 
The **Performance1-1** flavor has 1 VCPU assigned.

Depending on the flavor, VCPUs may be provided exclusively to your instance, or 
may be shared in a time slicing fashion with other virtual machines. XXXX**do we
 want to cover oversubscription here XXXX


RXTX_Factor
^^^^^^^^^^^

The amount of aggregate outbound bandwidth across all attached networks on your 
Cloud Server (PublicNet, ServiceNet, Cloud Networks). *(For more information on 
the different networks available to your Cloud Server, see XXXXX section.)* 
Maximum outbound public bandwidth is limited to 50% of the aggregate, while 
inbound traffic is not limited. In the case of **Performance1-1**, this means 
that you would be able to generate 80Mb/s (Megabits per second) of outbound 
traffic/bandwidth.


Changing the Flavor of your server
---------------------------------------------------------------------
These resources are fixed: i.e. you can not create a server and then change the
amount of RAM available to it (or disk, CPU, etc.). To change to a server with a
different set of resources ("Flavor"), you will need to create a new server and
migrate any applications and/or data to it.


Flavor Classes --------------


A Flavor Class is simply a grouping of Flavors based on similar characteristics
to help make easier decisions around technology choices, resources, or pricing
models. Common Flavor Classes at Rackspace are:


Performance 1
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
An entry level, high performance virtual server, with up to 8GB of RAM, 
8 virtual CPU, and 40GB system/80GB data SSD disk space. There is limited 
oversubscription of the CPU resources on Performance 1 flavors. 


Performance 2
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Performance 2 continues the use of high performance SSD storage, and extends 
resources up to 120GB of RAM, 32 virtual CPU, and 40GB System/1.2TB Data disk 
space.


Standard
^^^^^^^^
The Standard Flavor Class was originally launched with the Rackspace Next 
Generation Cloud in 2012. Although available in some scenarios, Rackspace 
recommends using a Performance or other flavor class which generally provides 
greater performance and value for an overall lower price. Standard flavors 
provide up to 30GB RAM, 8 virtual CPU, and 1.2TB of SATA (non-SSD) disk.

Choosing the right Flavor Class
===============================

Flavor Classes and Flavors are often defined and grouped such that they provide
meaningful guidance in selecting the right choice for your workload or
application. The process of choosing the right Flavor Class and Flavor is
generally analogous to choosing the resources and specifications you would for
physical hardware. Some examples are:


Web servers and other horizontally scaling application tiers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
As web servers, such as Apache or Nginx, typically derive their performance from
network bandwidth, and to a lesser extent CPU and RAM, versus disk space, 
choosing a **Performance 1** flavor can often be the right decisions. It has 
ample network bandwidth, and CPU and RAM allocations that often match today's 
highly optimized web server applications.


Database servers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
These servers, whether SQL or NoSQL, often benefit from very fast disk, and 
moderate to substantial amounts of RAM and CPU resources. While these servers 
can be both vertically and horizontally scaled in different scenarios, the 
application resources needed can often remain significant. In these cases, 
**Performance 2** might be a good choice.

Ultimately, choosing a Flavor Class and Flavor comes down to understanding your
application needs (both now and in the future), and balancing that against the
amount and type of resources it will need.


Region Availability for Flavor Classes 
======================================


Rackspace Cloud Servers are available to be created/consumed in multiple regions
(XXX link to description of regions wherever that is XXX). However, not all
Flavor Classes and Flavors may be available in all regions. When choosing a
Flavor Class & Flavor, be sure to check the available flavors for your region
via the OpenStack API, the Cloud Control Panel, or information on Rackspace.com.
