Understanding Cloud Servers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Create one or many Cloud Servers to give yourself computing power in the
Rackspace managed cloud.

If you create a Cloud Server and decide that it doesn't meet your needs
(for example, if an application you want to install is not compatible
with the operating system), simply delete that Cloud Server and create a
different one.

You can create Cloud Servers of two types:

* virtual servers

* OnMetal™ servers

This is an architectural overview of virtual servers:
