Host Issues
===========

Live-migrate
------------
Is a feature available to transparently increase server uptime for the user. It
allows a server to be migrated from one physical host to another with no
noticeable downtime or negative effects. Live-migrate is not an action that can
be performed by the user but is reserved for Rackspace engineers only.

Scheduled Outages
---------------------
Maintenance that impacts a server's uptime will be scheduled and
notifications are sent X days out to the primary contact's email address on the
account. Whenever possible the servers will be **Live-migrated** to a different 
physical host in order to avoid downtime.

Unscheduled Outages
-------------------
In the event there is a server uptime impacting outage on the physical host
notifications are sent to the primary contact's email address appraising them
of the situation. Email updates will follow until the issue is resolved. 
Whenever possible **Live-migrate** will be used to move servers off of a
physical host experiencing issues to avoid downtime.
