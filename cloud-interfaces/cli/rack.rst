Rackspace CLI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Rackspace Command Line Interface(*rack*) is a unified tool you can use to manage your Rackspace
services.

As opposed to using different clients to perform different tasks, *rack* requires
no additional plugins to allow additional functionality with the Rackspace Cloud.
Rackspace CLI utilizes `gophercloud <http://gophercloud.io/>`__, an Openstack
compatible SDK that allows for complete functionality with most Rackspace services.

.. note::

    Rackspace CLI is currently in beta. Therefore, some services and configurations
    may not be supported at this time.

Follow the `installation and configuration <https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/rack-cli/configuration/>`__
instructions from the `Rack CLI user guide <https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/rack-cli/>`__ to use *rack*.
