=====================
How to use this guide
=====================
We created this guide to help you get the most from your Rackspace cloud 
and especially from its core infrastructure:

* Cloud Servers

* Cloud Networks

* Cloud Images

* Cloud Block Storage

The guide is meant to simplify your startup process. 
It doesn't replace our detailed technical documentation, but we
hope it gives you a clear picture of
what, after getting started, you can do in the Rackspace cloud.

* :ref:`cloud_intro`
  provides a high-level overview of our core infrastructure, 
  explains how our cloud hosting differs from other kinds of hosting,  
  gives a brief tour of Rackspace cloud services,  
  and connects you to our collection of user stories.
 
* :ref:`cloud_interfaces` suggests several ways of
  controlling your configuration, including the GUI-based Cloud Control
  Panel and several CLIs, APIs, and SDKs.
 
* :ref:`cloud_config`, focusing on the core
  infrastructure, provides facts and suggestions to help you quickly
  establish a useful and manageable cloud configuration.
 
* :ref:`cloud_preprod` specifies pre-production steps you should
  take to harden your Cloud Server and make it ready for work.
 
* :ref:`cloud_ops` identifies ongoing
  responsibilities and suggests special-interest topics that may
  interest you after you are established in the cloud.
