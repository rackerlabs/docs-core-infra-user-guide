Software Development Kits
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Software development kits (SDKs) provide easy to use, language-specific 
interfaces for accessing and integrating APIs into your applications and 
workflows. Often these libraries also abstract the functionality required to 
support your applications and workloads across multiple cloud endpoints or 
providers.

.. note::

    The Rackspace SDKsare no longer actively supported or developed.

Rackspace created SDKs for the following languages:

* Go

* Java

* .Net

* Node.js

* PHP

* Python

* Ruby

You can find links to all the Rackspace-supported SDKs, with installation 
instructions, guidance, tutorials, and more for each, in the 
:rax-dev:`Rackspace Developer Center <sdks>`.
