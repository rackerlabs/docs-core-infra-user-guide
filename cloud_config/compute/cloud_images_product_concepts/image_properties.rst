Image properties
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When we talk about images in the Rackspace Cloud, what we’re really
referring to is an *image record* with which the image data file (for
example, a VHD) is associated. An image record consists of a set of
*image properties* (also known as *image metadata*) that describes the
image.

Image properties have several functions:

* They are used by the image owner to catalog the image. For example,
  public images provided by Rackspace have the
  **com.rackspace\_\_1\_\_release\_id** property which you can use to
  locate all available versions of a particular image. For images that
  you own, you may add your own cataloging properties so that you can
  efficiently search through your set of images.

* They are used by the Compute API to determine whether a request to
  boot a server from a particular image/flavor combination makes sense.
  For example, if the **min\_ram** property of an image is 512, then
  the specified flavor must provide at least 512 MB of RAM or the boot
  request will be rejected.

* They are used by the Compute Scheduler to locate a host for a server.
  For example, the **hypervisor\_version\_requires** property specifies
  what version of XenServer the image expects to find when it is
  booted.

* They are used by the hypervisor during the process of booting a
  server from an image. For example, the **auto\_disk\_config**
  property indicates whether the hypervisor should expand the disk
  partition and filesystem found on the image to fit the server’s
  system disk.

* They are used by Cloud Images in its handling of images. For example,
  if the **visibility** property indicates that an image is public, the
  image will be included in each user’s image list.

A set of image properties is maintained by Cloud Images itself. Users
(and in some cases, even system administrators) cannot modify these
properties. Among these properties are:

* **checksum**: the MD5 sum of the image data file

* **status**: the current state of the image. An image must be in **active**
  status in order to be used to boot a server.

* **owner**: indicates who owns the image

* **id**: a universally unique identifier (UUID) assigned to this image
