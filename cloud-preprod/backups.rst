.. _backups:

--------------------
Establishing backups
--------------------
Rackspace data centers are secure and reliable, but you might still
occasionally find
reasons to restore your data or your operating system to an earlier
time.

*  Use Cloud Images to be sure you can quickly create a new cloud server
   configured just like the one you have.

*  Use Cloud Backup to create incremental backups of a single cloud
   server.

*  Use Cloud Block Storage to create data on a portable drive image,
   moveable from one server to another.

For advice regarding when to use Cloud Backup and Cloud Block Storage, see
