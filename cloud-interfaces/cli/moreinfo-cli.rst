Learning more about CLIs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
CLIs that you can use to interact with the Rackspace cloud
are, or are consistent with,
the CLIs provided by OpenStack.

Useful information about these CLIs exists in sources published by
Rackspace and in sources published by OpenStack:

* `Rackspace Command-Line Interface user guide <https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/rack-cli/>`__
   documents all commands and configurations associated with Rackspace CLI.

* :os-docs:`OpenStack Command-Line Interface Reference <cli-reference/content>`
  documents all OpenStack CLIs.

* In the
  `Rackspace Community <https://community.rackspace.com/>`__,
  if you search for relevant keywords
  such as ``CLI`` or ``command line``,
  you can find and join useful conversations.
