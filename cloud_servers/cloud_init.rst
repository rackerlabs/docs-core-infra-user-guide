Cloud-init
==========
Cloud-init is a multi-distribution open source package developed by Canonical that handles the early initialization of a server running Linux. Cloud-init's behavior can be configured via customer supplied user-data. User-data is supplied via a config file written in cloud-config specific syntax that contains directives on how cloud-init should behave.
